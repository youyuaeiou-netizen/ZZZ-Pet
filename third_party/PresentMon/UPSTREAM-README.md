# PresentMon Console Application

The PresentMon/ directory contains source for a standalone console application that uses the
*PresentMon SDK* to capture and analyze graphics applications, outputting data to the console and/or
CSV file(s).

A binary of the console application is provided in the release, e.g.:
[PresentMon-2.3.1-x64.exe](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/releases/download/v2.3.1/PresentMon-2.3.1-x64.exe).

## Command line options

| Capture Target Options         |     |
| ------------------------------ | --- |

| `--exclude name`               | Do not record processes with the specified exe name.  This argument can be repeated to exclude multiple processes. |
| `--process_id id`              | Only record the process with the specified process ID. |
| `--etl_file path`              | Analyze an ETW trace log file instead of the actively running processes. |

| Output Options                 |     |
| ------------------------------ | --- |
| `--output_file path`           | Write CSV output to the specified path. |

| `--track_pc_latency`           | Track app timines for each displayed frame; requires application instrumentation using PC Latency events. |

## Comma-separated value (CSV) file output

### CSV file names

By default, PresentMon creates a CSV file named "PresentMon-\<Time>.csv", where "\<Time>" is the
creation time in ISO 8601 format.  To specify your own output location, use the `--output_file PATH`
command line argument.

If `--multi_csv` is used, then one CSV is created for each process captured and
"-\<ProcessName>-\<ProcessId>" is appended to the file name.

If `--hotkey` is used, then one CSV is created for each time recording is started and "-\<Index>" is
appended to the file name.

### CSV columns

Each row of the CSV represents a frame that an application rendered and presented to the system for
display, and each column contains a particular metric value associated with that frame.  All time values
are in milliseconds.

Default metrics include:

| Column Header          | Description |

| ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Hardware: Legacy Flip                 | Indicates the app took ownership of the screen, and is swapping the displayed surface every frame. |

| Hardware: Independent Flip            | Indicates the app does not have ownership of the screen, but is still swapping the displayed surface every frame. |
| Composed: Flip                        | Indicates the app is windowed, is using ["flip model" swapchains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model), and is sharing its surfaces with DWM to be composed. |
| Hardware Composed: Independent Flip   | Indicates the app is using ["flip model" swapchains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model), and has been granted a hardware overlay plane. |
| Composed: Copy with GPU GDI           | Indicates the app is windowed, and is copying contents into a surface that's shared with GDI. |
| Composed: Copy with CPU GDI           | Indicates the app is windowed, and is copying contents into a dedicated DirectX window surface. GDI contents are stored separately, and are composed together with DX contents by the DWM. |
